### THE GREENBACK’S BEHIND 

Please, please, please  
Leave the greenback  
Behind


There is new currency of  
A different  
Kind


Spending on love  
Feeds the soul you’ll  
Find


Investing in memories  
Becomes precious with  
Time

Paying for passion rides &  
Double down on your  
Dime

Please, please, please  
Leave the greenback  
Behind

Can the world have a  
Celebration for the new renumeration  
Of the unique  
Kind?

Only Time will tell  
If the Humans can  
Find

To leave, leave, leave  
That greenback  
Behind!
